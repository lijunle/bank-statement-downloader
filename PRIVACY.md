# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 27, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Bank Statement Downloader** browser extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your financial data remains secure and under your control.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No Financial Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your bank account numbers, balances, transaction history, or login credentials. All processing of your financial data occurs locally on your device.
- **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history, usage patterns, or analytics.

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely **client-side** (within your browser). When you visit a supported banking website, the extension interacts directly with that website to:

1.  Identify available bank statements.
2.  Present them in an organized list.
3.  Allow you to download them as PDF files.

Your banking session and data never leave your browser and are never sent to our servers or any third parties.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions to function:

- **`activeTab` / `tabs`:** Required to detect when you are on a supported banking website and to interact with the page to find statements.
- **`storage`:** Used to save your local preferences for the extension (e.g., UI settings). No personal or financial data is stored here.
- **Host Permissions:** Required to allow the extension to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions to download statement files from specific banking websites and external storage providers (e.g., Amazon S3).

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts directly with the banking websites you visit. It does not route your traffic through any intermediate servers. We do not share your data with any third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page.
